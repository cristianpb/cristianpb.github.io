This is my first post using jekyll.  I started to use it because I really like
the idea of writing my own website in [markdown
language](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), with [my favorite
text editor](https://github.com/vim/vim) and using [git](https://git-scm.com/)
to control the version of my files.  The result is a simple and fast static
(though javascript-powered) website on a free server.  In addition, I don't have
to log in to a (comparatively) slower, web browser based interface like
Wordpress. 

I started playing up with jekyll in local using the
[minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme with the following commands:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll bundler
$ jekyll new my-awesome-site
```

I can build the site by running `jekyll serve` inside my site directory. This
command launches a web server and auto-generate the site when a file is updated.
I can easily add a new post by putting a file in the `_posts` directory,
following the date convention (`YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext`). 

To customize the default structure and style, I copied the files that define the theme.
They can by found with the command `bundle show minima`. 
Then, I can modify the footer of my page with the file `_includes/footer.html`,
add new icons and accounts.

## Google analytics

I can also use [Google
analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) to track the
traffic of my website (_They are watching us!_).  Login to Google Analytics and
create a new property to receive a *Tracking ID* for your website. You will
find your Universal Analytics tracking code under _Admin > Property > Tracking
Info > Tracking Code_.

Now you need to reference your *Tracking ID* in your `_config.yml` file.
Replace UA—XXXXXXXX-X with your own unique *Tracking ID*:

```yaml
# Google services
google_analytics: UA—XXXXXXXX-X
```

## Disqus commments

Finally I can add comments inside the blog using [disqus comment
system](https://disqus.com/features/).  I create an account at
[disqus](https://disqus.com/) and then I can obtain a
[disqus_shorname](https://disqus.com/admin/universalcode/).  Remember to add
your site to the trusted domains feature in your
[settings](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/1261429).

Then I open `config.yml` and add the following code. Remember to change
`my_disqus_shortname` to your own Disqus shortname.

```yaml
# Disqus Comments
disqus:
    # Leave shortname blank to disable comments site-wide.
    # Disable comments for any post by adding `comments: false` to that post's YAML Front Matter.
    shortname: my_disqus_shortname
```

Comments and analytics are not enable by default in local because it is a
development environment. They are only available in production environment.
To run Jekyll in production environment use the following command to view your
site.

```bash
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Update

I started using [Emping theme](https://github.com/rmsubekti/emping). It offers
a more aesthetic design and also includes [_Amp
Page_](https://www.ampproject.org) implementation to improve charging time,
_Pagination_ for the blog, a nice _404 Error Page_, _SEO Gems_ and the _Share
Button_ with different social networks.
